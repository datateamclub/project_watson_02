# Project 2: Contradictory, My Dear Watson

For the second UM Data Team Club project we will be diving into Natural Language Inference (NLI). This time, our goal is to explore and analyze the relationships between different pairs of text to understand if one sentence logically follows from another. To do so, we will be attempting to solve the Contradictory, My Dear Watson challenge from Kaggle.

## Challenges
The objective of this project is to realize two NLI models. The first one using the **BERT** (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model from preset, and the second one using the same model but doing **Transfer Learning** (EXPLICAR).

## The Model
